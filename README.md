# prinscape3.1
This project is an app that people at Principia College or the Elsah/Alton area can use to find shopping, activities, and food nearby, and
relevant information for each place. The home screen features three buttons that take you to a list of food, shopping, or activities 
depending on what button you press. The list is sorted by distance to campus and shows the place, logo, and distance in miles. Tapping a 
place will pull up a specific view for that place that shows the name, rating, address, website, phone number, price, and distance. A list
of the sources we used are included in this repository, along with all of the project files.
